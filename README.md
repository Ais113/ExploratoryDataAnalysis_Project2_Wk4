In each of the R codes Plot1.R to Plot6.R update the setwd statement to set your working directory to the path along which you downloaded and unzipped the data to.

You should now be able to run the R code in each of of these 6 .R files.
Packages used, which may need to be installed:
ggplot2
ggrepel

Each one of these .R files will create a .png file in your working directory.
